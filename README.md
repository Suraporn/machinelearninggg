# machinelearninggg
## If you can share, you know what it is.

This is a repository for my personal Facebook and Youtube page called "machinelearninggg".
I intend to share my knowledge in Machine learning for Data scientist which I have learnt from my experience and my MDS program at UBC.
Therefore, knowledge in this repository is explicitly credited to the Master of Data Science program (MDS) at the University of British Columbia (UBC), Vancouver, Canada.

I fully recommend you to check the MDS program if you are looking into an intensive and comprehensive study in data science, I do love the program 100%, cheers!!
